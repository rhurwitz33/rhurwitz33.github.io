# Applications and Challenges of Sorting
What are hypothetical applications of your microfluidic sorter? Why is sorting challenging in uFluidics?

# Sorting Geometries
What geometries are conducive to efficient sorting?
Writeup clearly illustrates how the particle size and resin printing led to the dimensions in the CAD model. Put simply, your writeup would allow anyone to adapt your design to different particle sizes.

# Device Construction
Instructions for how to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device
Print and cure mold. 
Parylene device. 
Cast PDMS. 
Plasma bond glass slide. 
Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the 
PDMS?
