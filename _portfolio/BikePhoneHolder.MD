## Top-Down Modeling for Efficient Rapid Prototyping

Top-down modeling is used in computer aided design for multi-component systems, as the user can easily reference the dimensions of other parts by building the components in the same assembly. Components are designed in their exact position within the larger assembly rather than in a separate file, so they can be constrained in the position they were built. With top-down modeling, parameters can be used across components and features are projected into other designs. Top-down modeling was used in this bike phone holder design to achieve precise fits between components. For example, the phone case was designed around the iPhone 13 Pro by offsetting the projected filets. Similarly, the components attach to the bike handle with an offset of 0.2 mm, which was set by projecting the handlebar feature into the relevant sketch. The two components which attach to the handlebar were parametrically modeled, such that adjusting the offset for one component automatically changed the offset for the other component. Top-down modeling was helpful for quickly designing the components of the cylindrical container, rod, phone case, and adapter along the same axis.

## Bike Phone Holder Design and Assembly

This design relies on a swivel mechanism with compression springs to lock a shaft in place. As the user rotates the phone between horizontal and vertical positions, the central rod rotates, moving the shaft into a slight depression in the cylindrical compartment. This reversible locking mechanism occurs through one axis of rotation, avoiding the use of complex gears or larger components. As a result, the 3D print time for this bike phone holder is relatively short, allowing for rapid prototyping of the design. The phone case in this design was printed out of TPU 95A for tight fitting and flexibility, while the other components are PLA. 

To assemble the bike phone holder, first connect two springs opposite each other on the compartment lid using 6 mm screws. Then, slide the rod in the compartment lid, and screw on the small square adaptor component. Attach the square side of one handle attachment to the cylindrical compartment with two 6 mm screws. Connect the compartment lid to the cylindrical compartment with two 8 mm screws. The phone case attaches to the adaptor component with two 6 mm screws. Finally, the two handle attachments are screwed together to fit onto the handlebar.
